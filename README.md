# neural-networks-unplugged
This project demonstrates building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch using Python, without any ML libraries. It includes implementation of forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates. Perfect for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks step by step.
